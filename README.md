# Water Bottle Defect Detection System

A production-ready, real-time YOLO-based defect detection system for packaged water bottle production lines. The system uses an external USB webcam for live video capture and YOLOv8 for defect detection.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Live video streaming with YOLO object detection
- **External USB Webcam Support**: Configurable camera index for external webcams
- **Defect Classification**: Bottle shape (i.e. crumbled, not-crumbled), missing labels, bottle cap (i.e. cap, no cap)
- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive web interface with live feed, analytics, and defect history
- **Database Logging**: MongoDB integration for defect storage and analysis
- **Dark Theme UI**: Modern, responsive dark theme interface

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Camera Module** (`camera.py`): Handles external USB webcam initialization and frame capture
2. **YOLO Detector** (`yolo_detector.py`): YOLOv8 model loading, inference, and visualization
3. **Database Module** (`database.py`): MongoDB operations for defect logging and retrieval
4. **Flask Application** (`app.py`): Web server with MJPEG streaming and API endpoints
5. **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for live detection, dashboard, and history pages

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLOv8
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Camera**: External USB Webcam (configurable index)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8 or higher**
2. **MongoDB** (Install from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
3. **External USB Webcam**

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Install MongoDB

**Windows:**
1. Download MongoDB Community Server from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
2. Install and start MongoDB service
3. MongoDB will run on `localhost:27017` by default

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install mongodb

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community

# Start MongoDB
sudo systemctl start mongodb  # Linux
# or
mongod  # If not running as service
```

### Step 3: Configure External USB Webcam

## CRITICAL: External USB Webcam Setup

The system is configured to use an **EXTERNAL USB WEBCAM** (not your laptop's built-in camera).

### Finding Your Camera Index

1. **Connect your external USB webcam** to your computer

2. **List available cameras:**
   ```bash
   python camera.py
   ```
   
   Or run this Python command:
   ```bash
   python -c "import cv2; [print(f'Index {i}: Available') if cv2.VideoCapture(i).read()[0] else print(f'Index {i}: Not available') for i in range(5)]"
   ```

3. **Identify your external webcam:**
   - Index 0 is typically the built-in/laptop camera
   - Index 1, 2, 3, etc. are usually external USB webcams
   - Try opening each index to confirm which is your external webcam

4. **Update configuration:**
   Open `config.py` and set the `CAMERA_INDEX`:
   ```python
   CAMERA_INDEX = 1  # Change this to your external webcam index
   ```

### Testing Camera Access

Run this test script to verify your camera works:
```python
import cv2
from camera import Camera

cam = Camera(camera_index=1)  # Use your camera index
if cam.initialize():
    print("Camera initialized successfully!")
    frame = cam.get_frame()
    if frame is not None:
        print(f"Frame captured: {frame.shape}")
    cam.release()
else:
    print("Camera initialization failed!")
```

### Switching Between Webcams

1. Open `config.py`
2. Change `CAMERA_INDEX` to the desired camera index
3. Restart the application

### Troubleshooting Camera Issues

**Problem: Camera not detected**
- Ensure the external webcam is connected and powered on
- Try a different USB port
- Check if the camera works in other applications (e.g., Windows Camera app)
- Run `python camera.py` to list available cameras

**Problem: Camera index wrong**
- List all available cameras using the methods above
- Try different indices (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Restart the application after changing the index

**Problem: Permission denied (Linux)**
- Add your user to the `video` group: `sudo usermod -a -G video $USER`
- Log out and log back in
- On Ubuntu, you may need to grant camera permissions in system settings

**Problem: Camera already in use**
- Close other applications using the camera
- Restart the application

## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to configure:

- **Camera Settings**:
  - `CAMERA_INDEX`: External USB webcam index (default: 1)
  - `CAMERA_WIDTH`, `CAMERA_HEIGHT`: Video resolution
  - `CAMERA_FPS`: Frame rate

- **YOLO Model**:
  - `MODEL_PATH`: Path to YOLO model (default: "yolov8n.pt" - will download automatically)
  - `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: Detection confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
  - `IOU_THRESHOLD`: Non-maximum suppression threshold

- **Database**:
  - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string
  - `DATABASE_NAME`: Database name
  - `COLLECTION_NAME`: Collection name

- **Defect Logging**:
  - `DEFECT_LOGGING_COOLDOWN`: Cooldown period to avoid duplicate logging (seconds)

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Start MongoDB

Ensure MongoDB is running:

```bash
# Windows: MongoDB should start automatically as a service
# Or start manually:
mongod

# Linux/macOS:
sudo systemctl start mongodb
# or
mongod
```

### Step 2: Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will:
1. Initialize the external USB webcam
2. Load the YOLO model
3. Connect to MongoDB
4. Start the Flask web server

## YOLO Model Configuration

### Using Pretrained Model (Demo)

The system uses YOLOv8n (nano) by default, which will download automatically on first run. This is suitable for demonstration purposes.

**Note**: The pretrained YOLOv8 model is trained on COCO dataset and may not detect water bottle defects accurately. For production use, you need a custom-trained model.

### Training a Custom Model

> **Important**: Custom trained models are not included in this repository (`.gitignore`). If you clone this project, you'll need to train your own model or use the pretrained YOLOv8 model for demonstration.

This project includes two training scripts optimized for different dataset sizes:

#### Option 1: Standard Training Script (Recommended for 200+ images)

Use `train_custom_model.py` for standard datasets:

**Step 1: Prepare Your Dataset**

Organize your dataset in YOLO format:
```
bottle_defect_dataset/
  ├── images/
  │   ├── train/          # Training images
  │   └── val/            # Validation images
  ├── labels/
  │   ├── train/          # Training labels (.txt files)
  │   └── val/            # Validation labels (.txt files)
  └── data.yaml           # Dataset configuration
```

**Step 2: Create `data.yaml`**

Create a `data.yaml` file in your dataset directory:
```yaml
# Dataset paths (relative to data.yaml location)
path: .
train: images/train
val: images/val

# Number of classes
nc: 5

# class names
names:
  0: cap
  1: crumbled
  2: label
  3: no-cap
  4: not-crumbled
```

**Step 3: Collect and Annotate Images**

1. **Collect Images**: Gather images of water bottles with various defects
   - Recommended: 100-200+ images per defect class
   - Include normal bottles and various lighting conditions
   - Use diverse backgrounds and angles

2. **Annotate Images**: Use annotation tools to label defects
   - **Roboflow** (recommended): https://roboflow.com - Web-based, easy export to YOLO format
   - **LabelImg**: https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg - Desktop tool
   - **CVAT**: https://www.cvat.ai - Advanced web-based tool
   
3. **Export in YOLO Format**: Ensure labels are in YOLO format (.txt files)

**Step 4: Run Training**

```bash
python train_custom_model.py
```

The script will:
- Automatically detect your dataset size
- Configure optimal training parameters (epochs, batch size, augmentation)
- Train the model with progress updates
- Save the best model automatically

**Training Output**:
- Best model: `runs/detect/bottle_defects/weights/best.pt`
- Last checkpoint: `runs/detect/bottle_defects/weights/last.pt`
- Training plots: `runs/detect/bottle_defects/results.png`

#### Option 2: Few-Shot Learning (For 10-100 images)

Use `train_fewshot.py` for limited datasets:

```bash
python train_fewshot.py
```

This script uses aggressive data augmentation to maximize performance with limited data:
- Mosaic augmentation (combines 4 images)
- Mixup augmentation (blends images)
- Copy-paste augmentation
- Enhanced color/geometric transformations

#### Step 5: Configure the Application

After training completes, update `config.py`:

```python
# Update this line with your trained model path
MODEL_PATH = r"runs/detect/bottle_defects/weights/best.pt"

# Ensure class names match your data.yaml
DEFECT_CLASSES = {
  0: "cap"
  1: "crumbled"
  2: "label"
  3: "no-cap"
  4: "not-crumbled"
}
```

#### Step 6: Test Your Model

```bash
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` and test detection on the Live Detection page.

#### Training Tips

**For Best Results**:
- Use at least 100 images per class
- Include variety: different angles, lighting, backgrounds
- Balance your dataset (similar number of images per class)
- Use validation set (20% of total images)

**Hardware Recommendations**:
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (10x faster training)
- **CPU**: Training possible but slower (1-10 hours depending on dataset)
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended

**Troubleshooting**:
- If training is slow: Reduce batch size in the script
- If out of memory: Reduce batch size or image size
- If poor accuracy: Collect more diverse images, check annotations
- If overfitting: Increase dataset size or augmentation
